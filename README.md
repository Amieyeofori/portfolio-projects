## Continuous Monitoring Systems (CMS) â€“ Methane Emissions Framework  
**Status:** Private Project (Code not publicly available)  

A simulation-based framework for evaluating methane detection and repair strategies using continuous point sensor networks. Key features include:

- A Gaussian puff dispersion model implemented in Python  
- Site-level detection logic with equipment-level attribution  
- Temporal coverage tracking and emissions reduction analysis  
- Integration of meteorological inputs such as wind speed, direction, and stability class  
- Repair scheduling and mitigation estimation under varying delay scenarios
